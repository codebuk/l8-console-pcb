To run these scripts, you need a 'bash' environment available natively as Unix/Linux shells.
Or, under Windows, you'll need to install a special environment like MSYS2 (https://www.msys2.org) or Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com)

Please see "create_hellen_board_example.sh" for basic script usage.

For more script usage examples and some real projects, please see:
